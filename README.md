# TopoPyBox - proof of concept

## issues

- At this poit in time there are still absolute paths in use. (aspecttest, aspect.py)
- aspect is not calculating the aspect.

## How to Use

Compile the C files that get used by MATLAB and Python

```bash
  cd build/
  cmake ..
  make
```

Compile the mex_filename.c files (with MATLAB terminal)

```bash
  cd libMatlab/
  compile
```

## Manual Compiling

### for Python (with bash)

```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared -o compiledName.so uncompiledFile.c
```

### for MATLAB (with MATLAB)

```bash
mex uncompiledFile.c
```
